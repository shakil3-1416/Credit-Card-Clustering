# Credit-Card-Clustering
This project segments 9,000 credit card holders based on 18 behavioral variables over 6 months. The goal is to develop a clustering model to inform targeted marketing strategies. The repository includes data preprocessing, EDA, clustering, and customer profiling to optimize marketing efforts.


# Project Overview
This project involves customer segmentation based on the usage behavior of approximately 9,000 active credit card holders over a 6-month period. The dataset contains 18 behavioral variables at the customer level, which are analyzed to identify distinct customer segments. The goal is to develop a robust clustering model that can inform and optimize marketing strategies for different customer segments.

# Dataset Description
The dataset includes information on various behavioral aspects of credit card usage, such as spending patterns, credit limit usage, and payment behaviors. Each record represents a unique customer, with 18 features summarizing their activity over the last 6 months.

# Project Objectives
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for clustering, including handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the distribution of variables and identify patterns or trends.
Feature Selection: Identify the most relevant features for clustering based on statistical analysis and domain knowledge.
Clustering: Apply various clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, Hierarchical Clustering) to segment customers into distinct groups.
Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the clustering models using appropriate metrics like silhouette score and within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).
Customer Profiling: Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to develop customer profiles that can inform targeted marketing strategies.
# Key Features
Comprehensive EDA: Detailed analysis of customer behavior to uncover insights.
Clustering Techniques: Implementation of multiple clustering algorithms with a focus on interpretability and actionable results.
Visualization: Use of visualizations to illustrate the distribution of clusters and key features.
Customer Segmentation Strategy: Development of a segmentation strategy tailored to the unique characteristics of each customer group.
# Conclusion
The insights gained from this project can be used to design more effective marketing campaigns, personalize customer interactions, and optimize resource allocation for customer retention and acquisition.
